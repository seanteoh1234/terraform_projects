This is a simple Terraform project created by Sean.

This project aims to:
1. To learn how to use the variables block in the config file and how to pass data from the variables file to the configuration file.
2. To learn how to create a terraform configuration file that can launch an AWS VPC and a subnet under it. After making the VPC and subnet, use the newly created VPC ID and Subnet ID to create an EC2 instance.

Steps to use the Terraform.
1) Sign in to your account using AWS CLI

2) Run terraform init to install all the necessary plugins for your provider.

3) Run terraform plan to scan for syntax errors.

4) Run terraform apply to create instances using the terraform code.
