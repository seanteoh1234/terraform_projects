The goal of this project aims to:
1. Understand the type of backend states.
2. Understand the connection between variables.
3. Understand the usage of modules by using official Terraform modules and creating a module.
4. Understand how to run specific terraform steps dependent on other steps.

How to use?:
1. Change root file project_id to your Google Project ID.
2. Run terraform init to prepare terraform configurations.
3. Run terraform plan to check if there are any issues with the code and to show creation of resources.
4. Run terraform apply to create resources shown in terraform plan.

(Optional):
Upload your Terraform State File to the Cloud Storage Bucket after it is created so that your terraform status will be on cloud.
